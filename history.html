      <p>Padada National High School, formerly Hagonoy National High School Annex, is strategically situated in a one (1) hectare land located at Northern Paligue, Padada, Davao del Sur which has an estimated distance of 500 meters from the Davao – General Santos National Highway acquired from the joint funds of the Padada Local Government Unit (LGU) and the Provincial Government.</p>

      <p>The school operated in the year 1994 under the support of Padada LGU with Hon. Carmelo delos Cientos III as Municipal Mayor. It was then located at the Municipal Government Complex with Mr. Julio Estropia as the head of the school.</p>

      <p>With the municipal mayor's vision to establish a technical-vocational school in the municipality, he, together with the Vice-Mayor and the Sangguniang Bayan, made efforts for the school to be under the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). Eventually, in 1998 the school was named Carmelo delos Cientos Sr. National Trade School (CCNTS) after the name of the late father of the mayor, situated in a 1.5-hectare land at Southern Paligue, Padada, Davao del Sur acquired through the effort of Mr. Pablo Villaber. This time, the school was already offering secondary and vocational courses with the leadership of Dr. Nicasio Estudillo.</p>

      <p>However, with the rationalization scheme between the Department of Education and TESDA, the supervision of the secondary department was turned over to the former in June 2002, bearing the name Hagonoy National High School Annex with the stewardship of Mr. Ricardo U. Pillerin.</p>

      <p>Due to this event, the school had no other choice but to look for a new location since the land that it occupied was owned by TESDA. The school transferred to its present site on October 8, 2003.</p>

      <p>In June of 2008, Mr. Ricardo Pillerin was recalled to his original station at Sulop National High School and was replaced by Mr. Emeterio S. Lobitos, Jr.</p>

      <p>In August 2008, Hagonoy National High School Annex was separated from its mother school by virtue of Republic Act 9540, otherwise known as an act establishing Padada National High School. This made the latter possess juridical personality and become an independent school.</p>

      <p>In 2011, Padada National High School established its extension classes in Barangay Lower Malinao headed by Mr. Ruden B. Gomez and Barangay Piape led by Dr. Elizabeth S. Solano.</p>

      <p>Padada National High School (PNHS) opens different programs in order to cater to all learners in the community. In 2009, Special Education (SPED) program was offered to help learners with Learning Disabilities (LD) and Hearing Impaired (HI). Seeing the impact of this to the community, the school then ventured into another field of learning to hone talented students in the field of arts; thus, the Special Program in the Arts (SPA) on different fields of specialization—Visual Arts, Dance, Voice, Media Arts, and Creative Writing—was born in 2012.</p>

      <p>With the onset of Senior High School (SHS), PNHS offers two tracks: General Academic Strand and Tech-Voc with the following specializations: Computer System Servicing, Hairdressing, Housekeeping, Plumbing, and Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW).</p>
